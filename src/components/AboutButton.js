            I have been interested in coding for some time now and last year I
            officially took the leap and left my teaching post to pursue a
            career in software development! Since then, I have become skilled in
            various frontend and backend technologies with a particular focus on
            React and Node/Express.js.

            Through this website, which has been created using React, as well as
            my CV, you will be able to see the skills that I have learnt so far.
            I say â€˜so farâ€™ as I am always learning new skills and putting those
            skills to the test to ensure I have mastered them. As a former
            teacher, I am great at learning and quick at picking up new things.
            I am passionate about continuously developing myself and becoming
            the best at anything I do. This in turn makes me passionate about
            software development as there are always new things to learn and
            areas to master!

            Outside of coding, I am continuously taking it upon myself to learn
            new things. I am super creative and my ever-growing list of hobbies
            include: embroidering, crocheting, oil painting, wall panelling,
            sewing, gardening, henna, reading, working out, photography, video
            editing (and watching a LOT of TV!) - you name it!
