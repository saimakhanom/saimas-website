					<p className="content">Hi, my name is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/saimakhanom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Saima Khanom</a>. I am currently a FrontEnd Developer Intern at Uplifter Ltd and a former A-level Science teacher.</p>
					<br />
					<p className="content">I have been interested in coding for some time now and this year I officially took the leap and left my teaching post to pursue a career in software development! Since then, I have learnt HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React, and I am currently learning SQL. My ambition is to become a full-time React developer on my way to becoming a full-stack engineer and so I am currently on the hunt for a Junior React Developer role.</p>
					<br />
					<p className="content">Through this website, which has been created using React, as well as my CV, you will be able to see the skills that I have learnt so far. I say â€˜so farâ€™ as I am always learning new skills and putting those skills to the test to ensure I have mastered them. As a former teacher, I am great at learning and quick at picking up new things. I am passionate about continuously developing myself and becoming the best at anything I do. This in turn makes me passionate about software development as there are always new things to learn and areas to master!</p>
					<br/>
					<p className="content">Outside of coding, I am continuously taking it upon myself to learn new things. I am super creative and my ever-growing list of hobbies include: embroidering, crocheting, oil painting, wall panelling, sewing, henna, reading, working out, photography, video editing (and watching a LOT of TV!) - you name it!</p>
