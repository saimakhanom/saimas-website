              I am a former teacher with over 7 years of teaching experience in
              various education settings. I have recently left the education
              sector to pursue a career in software development. I am skilled in
              frontend languages such as HTML, CSS, JS and React.JS as
              demonstrated by this portfolio website which was built from
              scratch using React. I am currently learning backend languages
              such as SQL to expand my skill set. I aim to become a React
              Developer as a stepping stone to becoming a full-stack engineer.
              My problem-solving approach to coding and ability to master new
              skills quickly lends itself to the creation and maintenance of
              functional and quality websites.
